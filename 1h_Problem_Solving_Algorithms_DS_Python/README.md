The interactive book can be found [here](https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html)

This books covers basic-to-intermediate concepts involving Python's Algorithms and Data Structures.
I am following the book and the excersizes using IPython Jupyter installed in a virtual envelop. To easily configure your system for multiple Python/IPython versions, [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/244641/how-to-set-up-and-use-a-virtual-python-environment-in-ubuntu) is an excelent resource.
