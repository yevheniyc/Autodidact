	NOTE:
		proper way to count the number of words is to count 
		the number of non-whitespace character to whitespace character 
		transitions in the data stream. To do this we must somehow examine 
		all two-character sequences in the stream. Simple solution is 
		to use a flag variable to keep track of whether or not weâ€™re 
		currently in a word. When the flag is set and whitespace is encountered 
		then increment the word count and reset the flag. The flag will be set 
		every time a non-whitespace character is encountered.
