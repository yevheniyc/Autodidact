Brief dbx command summary:

Brief dbx command summary:
run 			Starts execution from beginning of program
step  			Executes the next statement
cont			Resumes execution
status			Prints out all pending dbx instructions (trace, stop, etc.)
trace			Traces line by line the execution of the program
where			Displays current location
stop at #		Insert breakpoint - execution will stop before executing statement at specified line number
print expr		Evaluates expression, then displays the result
delete #		Removes specified dbx instruction - number is obtained from first value of status output
Notes:
To effectively use dbx, make sure that you have a line numbered listing of your source file:
      1. cat -n sourcefile.c | lpr
      2. gcc -g -o sourcefile sourcefile.c
      3. dbx sourcefile

Be aware that when a program is compiled with the -g option, it will behave differently than under normal compilation. For example, all integers, unless otherwise specified, are automatically initialized to zero. Under normal situations, no initialization is performed. This can cause a program that is buggy to work correctly when compiled for the debugger!
