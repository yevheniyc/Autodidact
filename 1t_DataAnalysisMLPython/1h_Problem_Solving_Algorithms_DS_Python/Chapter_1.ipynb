    "\n",
    "**Abstract Data Type**: a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class**: a description of what the data look like (the state) and what the data can do (the behavior). Classes are analogous to abstract data types because a user of a class only sees the state and behavior of a data item. Data items are called objects in the object-oriented paradigm. An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists**, **strings**, and **tuples** are ordered collections.\n",

    "#####Problem:\n",
    "The theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text (i.e. the complete works of William Shakespeare). Let's start with generating a simple sentence:\n",
    "    methinks it is like a weasel\n",
    "    \n",
    "#####Solution:\n",
    "1. Write a function that generates a string of 27 characters long by choosing random letters from the 26 letters in the alphabet, plus the space.\n",
    "2. Write another function that will score each generated string by comparing the randomly generated string to the goal.\n",
    "3. Write a third function that will repeatedly call generate and score functions, then if 100% of the letters are correct, we are done! If the letters are note correct then we will genereate a whole new string. To make it easier to follow your program's progress this third function should print out the best string generated so far and its score every 1000 tries.\n",
    "4. Then improve the algorithm by keeping letters that are correct and only modifying one character in the best string so far. This is a type of algorithm in the class of **hill climbing** algorithms, that is we only keep the result if it is better than the previous one."
